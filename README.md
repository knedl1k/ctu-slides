# ctu-slides
Unofficial LaTeX template for university presentations in CTU design.

## License
The source code for this template (LaTeX macros, structure, styles) is released under the **MIT** license. You are free to use, modify, and distribute it as long as you retain the author information.

**⚠️ Note on logos and graphics:**
The logos and symbols of CTU (and its respective parts) contained in this repository **are not** part of the MIT license. These graphics are the exclusive property of the university and are subject to its protection.

The logo files are included in the template solely for the convenience of users (students and employees) so that they can immediately use the template for academic purposes in accordance with the university's visual style.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Requirements
* A standard TeX distribution (TeX Live, MiKTeX, or MacTeX).
* **Important:** You should use the **LuaLaTeX** engine to compile the presentation. The standard `pdflatex` will not work because the template loads OpenType (`.otf`) fonts directly.

### 2. Folder Structure
To ensure the template works out-of-the-box, maintain the following directory structure:
* `fonts/` – Font directory containg Technika font files (e.g., `Technika-Book.otf`, `Technika-Bold.otf`, etc.).
* `media/` – Directory for images and logos (e.g., `logo_CTU_vertical.pdf`).
* `ctu-slides.sty` – The main style file.
